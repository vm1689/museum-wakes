## Act I — The Golden Age and the Murder

### Osiris as King

Osiris was the firstborn of Geb (earth) and Nut (sky), born on the first of five intercalary days Thoth won from the moon. He became Egypt's first king and civilizer:

- Taught humanity agriculture — how to grow crops
- Gave them laws and taught them to honor the gods
- Traveled the world "winning over peoples by the charm of his persuasive discourse combined with song and all manner of music"
- Represented the ideal pharaoh: just, peaceful, beloved

Isis and Osiris "were enamored of each other and slept together in the darkness of the womb before their birth" — their bond was cosmic and predestined.

### Set's Conspiracy

Set, Osiris's jealous brother, conspired with seventy-two accomplices. During a feast, he produced an ornate chest (coffin) crafted to Osiris's exact measurements. He offered it as a prize to whoever fit inside perfectly. When Osiris lay in it:

- The conspirators slammed the lid shut
- Nailed it closed and sealed it with molten lead
- Cast the chest into the Nile, where it drifted out to sea

The number 72 has astronomical significance — it matches the 72 days Sirius (Isis's star) is absent from the night sky each year.

### Set's Motivation

Set embodied chaos, storms, the desert, and disorder. His envy of Osiris's kingship and popularity drove the murder. In some versions, Set also resented that his wife Nephthys had secretly conceived a child (Anubis) with Osiris.

## Act II — Isis's Search and the Resurrection

### The Search

Isis cut her hair in mourning and began an exhaustive search:

1. **The chest at Byblos:** The coffin washed ashore at Byblos (in modern Lebanon), where a great heather tree grew around it, enclosing Osiris within its trunk. The king of Byblos cut the tree down and used it as a pillar in his palace.
2. **Isis's cunning:** She befriended the queen's servants, then the queen herself. She served as nursemaid to the prince, eventually revealing herself and claiming the pillar.
3. **Recovery:** She opened the coffin, "laid her face upon the face within and caressed it," weeping.

### The Dismemberment

Set discovered the recovered body and tore it into **fourteen pieces**, scattering them across Egypt. Isis, aided by her sister Nephthys, searched again and found thirteen of the fourteen pieces. The only piece never recovered was the phallus (swallowed by a fish in the Nile).

**The fourteen pieces** and their locations became sacred sites throughout Egypt — each town that claimed a piece built a shrine, making the entire land holy ground.

### The First Mummification

Isis reassembled Osiris's body and, with the help of Anubis and Thoth:
- Bound him in linen wrappings — **creating the first mummy**
- His skin turned green (the color of rebirth and vegetation)
- She used her magical wings to fan breath back into him — enough to conceive Horus
- But Osiris could not fully return to the living world

Osiris descended to rule the Duat (underworld), becoming lord and judge of the dead.

---

## Act III — Horus Rising

### Birth and Hiding

Isis fled to the papyrus marshes of the Nile Delta (Khemmis) to give birth to Horus in secret, hiding him from Set. She raised him alone, fiercely protective:

- Horus was stung by scorpions, bitten by snakes — Isis healed him each time with her magic
- Osiris trained Horus from the underworld, preparing him for battle
- Images of Isis nursing Horus became the most popular devotional art in Egypt

### The Contendings of Horus and Set

When Horus matured, he challenged Set before the tribunal of the Ennead (nine great gods). This trial lasted **eighty years**:

**Key episodes:**
1. **The legal argument:** Most gods favored Horus, but Ra argued he was too young. The goddess Neith ruled in Horus's favor, proposing Set receive the desert while Horus governed the Nile Valley.
2. **Battles and contests:** The gods ordered competitions to prove worthiness. In combat, Set gouged out Horus's left eye; Horus castrated Set.
3. **The Eye of Horus:** Thoth healed the damaged eye, restoring it. Horus then offered his restored eye to Osiris in the underworld — its revitalizing power sustaining Osiris eternally. This is why the Eye of Horus (Wedjat) became a symbol of healing, protection, and wholeness.
4. **Isis's trick:** Isis disguised herself as a beautiful widow and told Set a story of a wicked man who killed her husband and threatened her son. Set condemned the man — inadvertently condemning himself by his own decree.
5. **Horus's rage:** When Isis released Set without punishment out of pity, Horus was so enraged he attacked his own mother, severing her head. Thoth replaced it with a cow's head (connecting Isis to Hathor).
6. **Resolution:** The gods declared Horus the rightful king. Set was given lordship over storms, the desert, and foreign lands.

## The Four Principal Deities — Deep Profiles

### Osiris — Lord of the Dead

**Domains:** Afterlife, resurrection, agriculture, fertility, the Nile flood, vegetation, civilization

**Appearance:**
- Mummiform body (wrapped from chest down)
- Green or black skin — green for rebirth, black for Nile silt fertility
- Atef crown: white crown of Upper Egypt flanked by two ostrich feathers
- Holds the crook (shepherd/kingship) and flail (agriculture/judgment)

**Key Symbols:**
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Crook & flail | Kingship and agricultural fertility |
| Djed pillar | Stability, endurance; possibly represents his spine |
| Atef crown | Divine authority over the dead |
| Green skin | Rebirth, vegetation, the renewal of life |
| Black skin | Fertile Nile soil, the land itself |

**As Judge of the Dead:**
In the Hall of Two Truths, Osiris presided over the Weighing of the Heart ceremony:
1. The deceased recited the "Negative Confessions" before 42 Assessors of Ma'at, declaring sins they did not commit
2. Anubis placed the heart on scales against the feather of Ma'at (truth)
3. Thoth recorded the verdict
4. If balanced: the soul entered the Field of Reeds (paradise)
5. If heavy with sin: the heart was devoured by Ammit (crocodile-lion-hippo demon) — the soul ceased to exist

**Connection to the Nile:** Osiris's death and resurrection mirrored the annual Nile flood. The waters were equated with Isis's tears or Osiris's bodily fluids. When the flood receded and crops grew, it was Osiris reborn.

**Worship center:** Abydos — believed to be his burial place. Egyptians across millennia sought burial there to be near him.

---

### Isis — Goddess of Magic

**Domains:** Magic, healing, motherhood, wisdom, protection, funerary rites, the throne

**Appearance:**
- Human woman wearing a throne hieroglyph on her head (her name literally means "throne/seat")
- Later depicted with cow horns and sun disk (merged with Hathor)
- Often shown with outstretched wings (protective, life-giving)
- Nursing Horus in the iconic mother-and-child pose

**Key Symbols:**
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| Throne (hieroglyph) | Her name; she IS the throne of Egypt |
| Tyet (Knot of Isis) | Protection, welfare, life; placed on mummies |
| Wings | Resurrection power — she fans breath into the dead |
| Sistrum (rattle) | Warding off evil spirits |
| Star Sirius (Sopdet) | Her celestial form; its rising signaled the Nile flood |

**Her Magic:**
- The most powerful magician in the Egyptian pantheon
- Tricked Ra himself: she created a serpent from his own saliva that bit him. In agony, Ra revealed his secret true name — giving Isis power over all creation
- Created the Duat (underworld) for Osiris
- Her spells could heal the sick, protect the living, and resurrect the dead

**Self-proclamation (from ancient inscription):**
> *"I am Isis, the mistress of every land... I gave and ordained laws for men, which no one is able to change... I divided the earth from the heaven. I showed the paths of the stars. I ordered the course of the sun and moon... I am she who is called goddess by women... I overcome Fate. Fate hearkens to me."*

**Worship spread:** From Egypt across the entire Mediterranean. Temples at Philae (Egypt), Pompeii (Italy), and throughout Greece and Rome. Her cult lasted into the 6th century CE — one of the longest-running religious traditions in history.

**Appearance:**
- Falcon-headed man, or a full falcon
- Wears the Double Crown (pschent) of unified Upper and Lower Egypt

2. **Horus the Younger (Harsiese/Harpocrates):** Son of Isis and Osiris. The avenger, the rightful heir. The Horus of the Osiris myth cycle.

**The Eye of Horus:**
- His left eye (the moon) was gouged out by Set during their battle
- Thoth healed it, making it whole again — the "Wedjat" (meaning "the whole one")
- Horus offered the restored eye to Osiris, sustaining him in the afterlife
- The Eye became one of Egypt's most powerful protective amulets
- Its six parts corresponded to the six senses and to fractions used in measurement
- Placed on mummies, painted on boats, worn by the living

**The Pharaoh IS Horus:**
- Every living pharaoh was considered an incarnation of Horus
- Upon death, the pharaoh became Osiris, and the new king became Horus
- The earliest royal symbol (Serekh) depicted a falcon on a perch
- Pharaohs took a "Horus Name" at coronation

**The Four Sons of Horus** (protectors of canopic jars):

| Hapy | Baboon | Lungs | North |
| Duamutef | Jackal | Stomach | East |
| Qebehsenuef | Hawk | Intestines | West |

### Set — God of Chaos, Storms, and the Desert

**Domains:** Chaos, storms, desert, violence, foreigners, necessary destruction, the Red Land

**Appearance:**
- The "Set animal" — a mysterious composite creature with a curved snout, tall rectangular ears, and a stiff forked tail. No real animal matches it exactly; scholars have proposed aardvark, fennec fox, donkey, or an extinct species.
- Also depicted as a red-haired beast with cloven hooves
- Sometimes shown as a hippo or a black pig
- Human form: a man with the Set animal's head
- Associated with the color **red** — red hair, red skin, the red desert (deshret)

**Key Symbols:**
| Symbol | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| The Set animal (sha) | An unidentifiable composite beast unique to Set |
| Red color | Blood, fire, desert sand, danger |
| Was scepter | Power, dominion (shared with other gods but originally Set's emblem) |
| Desert (deshret) | The Red Land — everything beyond the fertile Nile Valley |
| Donkey, pig | Sacred animals associated with Set |

**The Complicated God:**
Set is the most morally complex deity in the Egyptian pantheon. He is not simply evil — the Egyptians understood him as a necessary force:

- **Protector of Ra:** Each night, as Ra's sun barge traveled through the underworld, the chaos serpent Apophis tried to devour the sun and prevent dawn. Set stood at the prow of the barge, spear in hand, and was the only god who could resist Apophis's hypnotic stare. He struck the serpent down night after night. Without Set, the sun would never rise.
- **Lord of the Desert:** The desert was dangerous, but it also defined and protected Egypt. Set ruled the boundary between civilization and the unknown.
- **Storm bringer:** His storms could destroy, but they also brought rain to the edges of the desert.
- **Balance to Horus:** In the earliest theology, Set and Horus were equals — the "Two Lords." Set ruled Upper Egypt (south), Horus ruled Lower Egypt (north). Both officiated at the pharaoh's coronation. Together they represented cosmic balance.

**Historical Arc — From Hero to Villain:**

| Period | Set's Status |
|--------|-------------|
| **Predynastic / Early Dynastic** (before 2613 BCE) | Benevolent protector god. His name appeared on love charms and amulets. Worshipped alongside Horus as co-ruler. |
| **Old & Middle Kingdom** | Respected as a powerful but dangerous force. His warrior strength was admired. |
| **Hyksos Period** (c. 1650-1550 BCE) | Foreign Hyksos rulers adopted Set as their chief deity, seeing their own conquest reflected in his power. |
| **New Kingdom** (c. 1550-1069 BCE) | After Egypt expelled the Hyksos, Set became tainted by foreign association. Increasingly cast as the villain of the Osiris myth. Yet pharaohs like **Seti I** and **Seti II** still proudly bore his name. |
| **Late Period & Ptolemaic** | Fully demonized. Temples neglected, statues defaced. Became the embodiment of evil. |

This arc is remarkable: the same god went from being invoked in love spells to being defaced on temple walls, over ~2,000 years.

**Family:**
- **Brother** of Osiris, Isis, Nephthys, and Horus the Elder
- **Husband** of Nephthys (who secretly conceived Anubis with Osiris — one of Set's motivations for murder)
- **Wives** also included foreign goddesses: Anat (warrior goddess from Syria) and Astarte (Queen of Heaven from Phoenicia) — given to him as consolation when Horus won the throne
- **Consort:** Tawaret (hippo-headed fertility goddess)

**Cult Centers:**
- **Ombos (Naqada)** — his primary temple, maintained from the Early Dynastic Period
- **Avaris** — the Hyksos capital in the Delta, where Set was elevated to supreme god
- **Sepermeru** — Ramesses II built a temple to Set in this capital city

**His Murders and Schemes (Full Detail):**

1. **The Coffin Trap:** Commissioned an ornate chest built to Osiris's exact body measurements. At a feast with 72 co-conspirators, offered it to whoever fit inside. When Osiris lay in it, the lid was nailed shut, sealed with molten lead, and thrown into the Nile.
2. **The Dismemberment:** When Isis recovered the body, Set found it again, tore it into 14 pieces, and scattered them across Egypt — an act of pure spite to prevent resurrection.
3. **The 80-Year War:** Fought Horus in every form — as hippos, as bulls, in celestial courts. Gouged out Horus's left eye (the moon). Was castrated by Horus in return. Used deception, brute force, and legal arguments before the Ennead. Lost when his own words condemned him.
4. **Desert storms and attacks:** Sent storms and creatures against the infant Horus hiding in the marshes. Isis had to constantly protect her son from Set's agents.

**Legacy and Contradiction:**

In one temple inscription, Set is condemned as the murderer of Osiris. In the very next line, he is celebrated as the warrior who saved the sun. This duality defined how the Egyptians understood him — not as pure evil, but as a necessary and dangerous force whose role shifted across millennia.

> *"Set was not chaos unleashed, but chaos mastered — channeled into the defense of cosmic order."*

2. Recites the 42 Negative Confessions ("I have not stolen, I have not killed...")
3. Anubis places the heart on one side of the scales

## Key Theological Concepts

### Ma'at — Cosmic Order
Ma'at is truth, justice, harmony, and the proper order of the universe. When Set murdered Osiris, Ma'at was violated. Horus's victory restored it. The entire myth cycle can be understood as the disruption and restoration of Ma'at.

### The Afterlife as Continuation
The Egyptians did not view death as an ending but as a transition. Osiris died yet rules the underworld. The elaborate funerary practices — mummification, spells, amulets, offerings — were preparations for an eternal continuation of life.

### The Power of Names
Isis gained supreme power by learning Ra's true name. In Egyptian belief, to know something's true name was to have power over it. Names were essential to existence — one of the greatest fears was having one's name erased, which meant true annihilation.

### The Bond Between Living and Dead
Horus offered his healed eye to sustain Osiris in the afterlife. The living performed regular offering rituals to nourish the dead. The dead, in turn, watched over and protected the living. Egyptian religion maintained a continuous relationship across the boundary of death.
